# What is Blockchain

Blockchain is Distributed Ledge that is open to anyone in the blockchain network. Each block contains 1) Data 2) Hash and 3) Hash of previous block. The data stored inside each block depends on application domain. For example, each block inside bitcoin blockchain may contain the information about From, To and Amount. Hash is like a fingerprint that can be used to uniquely identify each block in the network. Hashes are very useful to detect any changes in a block because modifying or updating data inside a block causes to generate new hash.

Genesis block: the first block of blockchain network which doesn't contain hash of previous block.

Blockchain can be secured by the use of HASHING and PROOF OF WORK.
Proof of Work: 

Blockchain technology can be used in storing medical records, e-notary or even collecting taxes.

Smart contracts is a tiny program stored inside blockchain.

Smart contracts can be used in crowdfunding platforms.

Smart contracts are immutable and distributed.
