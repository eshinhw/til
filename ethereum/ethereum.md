## Ethereum Accounts in MetaMask

1. Account Address
2. Public Key
3. Private Key

- Public and Private keys are used to authorize the transaction activities between accounts.
- All three components are stored in hexadecimal numbers.
- One account is used across all networks. There is no need to create separate accounts for each network unless we very specifically want to.
