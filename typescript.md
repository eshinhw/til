# TypeScript

JavaScript is a dynamic typing language which is prone to make unexepcted type errors. TypeScript tries to fix the drawbacks of dynamic typing language by forcing users to declare types.

`tsc -w` : running in the background and automatically convert ts codes into js codes.

## Primitive Types

- String
- Number
- Bigint
- Boolean
- Null and Undefined
- Symbol

```typescript
let firstName: string = "eddie";
let phoneNumber: number = 123456;
let marriage: boolean = false;
```
