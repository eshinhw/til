# Ethereum

## What is Ethereum?

 - The White Paper, "Ethereum: The Ultimate Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform" discusses the need for more programmatic control over transactions.
- Wanted to enable the creation of 'Decentralized Autonomous Corporations (DAC)'.
- Introduces the idea of 'Smart Contracts' as an entity that can send and receive currency, beyond just humans.

## Ethereum Accounts in MetaMask

1. Account Address
2. Public Key
3. Private Key

- Public and Private keys are used to authorize the transaction activities between accounts.
- All three components are stored in hexadecimal numbers.
- One account is used across all networks. There is no need to create separate accounts for each network unless we very specifically want to.
- Each network is independently operated by the same account information. Thus, there is no share of information between the networks even using the same account credential.

## Ethereum Network

- When a transaction is created and sent to the Ethereum network, it goes to one specific node inside the network.
- Blockchain is essentially a database. 
- Inside a node, there is a copy of blockchain. Each block aggregates all transactions arrived at the node. Then, node runs some validation logic on the block which takes approximately 30 seconds which refers to as Mining.

## Why Bitcoin and Blockchain Systems are So Complicated?

- They have to be robust enough to replace the current financial system.

## Smart Contracts

- Smart Contracts are accounts controlled by code

## Wei vs Ether

- 1 Ether == 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 Wei
